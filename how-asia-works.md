Part 1: Agriculture
- Free markets fails to maxmize agriculture yields. Land ownership concentration/rent easier source of income. 
- Land reform programmes in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Dividing land to create small household farms. Government support to maximize production. 
- Large scale capitalist farms are more capital/labour efficient but early stage develping state with surfeit labour should be maximising production with labour with small labour intensive vegetable gardens.
- Most productive plots utilize solid leaf canopy / verticle gardening because close planting minimize water loss and discourage weeds.
- Vegetable gardens per area yelds higher $$ value than large-scale cash corp farming. Eg. [Seed Money](seedmoney.org)
- Efficiency in small-scale farming supported by infrastructures to delivery inputs such as fertilisers and seeds, and to facilitate storage, marketing and sales. 
- Good land policy (egalitarian household farming) + infrastructure = development. 
- Taiwan (1950s rice/sugar => 1960s asparagus/mushrooms), most successful agricultural development story in Asia. 
- Agricultural output increases => surplus => 
 1. savings => industrial investment financing
 2. rural consumption => consumer goods demand
 3. Spend less on imported food / More on imported technology
 - Latin America's increasing manufacturing exports bled by stagnant agricultural output. "urban bias" (Michael Lipton), urban elites undervaluing farmers.
 - Household farms' welfare role. In economic downturns, absorb unemployed and backup income.
