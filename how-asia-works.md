Part 1: Agriculture
- Free markets fails to maxmize agriculture yields. Land ownership concentration/rent easier source of income. 
- Land reform programmes in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Government support to maximize production. 
- Large scale capitalist farms are more capital/labour efficient but early stage develping state with surfeit labour should be maximising production with labour with small labour intensive vegetable gardens.
- Most productive plots utilize solid leaf canopy / verticle gardening because close planting minimize water loss and discourage weeds.
- Vegetable gardens per area yelds higher $$ value than single corp large-scale farming. Eg. [Seed Money](seedmoney.org)
